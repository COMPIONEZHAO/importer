
TODO:
==============

- Add better defined Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) support, 
  leveraging Tika GDAL support.
- Add a counter as method argument to AbstractStringTagger so we know which 
  "chunk" of text we are processing (1st, 2nd, etc).
- Improve new parsers:
    - Add unit tests for new parsers.
    - Extract WordPerfect footnotes and maybe more valuable text?
