
TODO:
==============

- Add new Tagger, Filter, Transformers, Splitters that support Java scripting.

- Add better defined Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) support, 
  leveraging Tika GDAL support (requires external app install, like
  Tesserac OCR feature).

- Create an ImageConverterTransformer that would convert images from/to
  format of choice. This could allow for instance to convert some 
  formats non-supported by Tesseract OCR into some that are.
