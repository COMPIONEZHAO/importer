
TODO:
==============

- Have content type parsers configurable via XML.

- Have global way to configure disabling parsing of embedded resources 
  (either content and metadata, or just metadata -- which seems to cause 
  OOM Exceptions in rare cases).

- Add better defined Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) support, 
  leveraging Tika GDAL support (requires external app install, like
  Tesserac OCR feature).

- Create an ImageConverterTransformer that would convert images from/to
  format of choice. This could allow for instance to convert some 
  formats non-supported by Tesseract OCR into some that are.
