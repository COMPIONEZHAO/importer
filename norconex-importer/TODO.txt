
TODO:
==============

- Remove custom PDF parser given latest Tika now supports PDFBox 2.0.1.
  (make sure any custom tweaks are still supported, and that XFA extracation
  is enabled out of the box).

- Use Tika improved Language detection module instead of 
  current one.

- Remove FixedHtmlEncodingDetector in favor of Tika original one
  when Tika 1.11 is released.  See:
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-1837
    https://github.com/Norconex/collector-http/issues/223

- Investigate Tika Named Entity Parser: 
  https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaAndNER

- Investigate Tika Natural Language Toolkit: 
  https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaAndNLTK

- Maybe ship with a default tika-config on a given path so it can easily be
  modified: https://tika.apache.org/1.12/configuring.html

- Added Yandex translation support now in Tika: 
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-1943

- Have content type parsers configurable via XML.

- Have global way to configure disabling parsing of embedded resources 
  (either content and metadata, or just metadata -- which seems to cause 
  OOM Exceptions in rare cases).

- Add better defined Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) support, 
  leveraging Tika GDAL support (requires external app install, like
  Tesserac OCR feature).

- Create an ImageConverterTransformer that would convert images from/to
  format of choice. This could allow for instance to convert some 
  formats non-supported by Tesseract OCR into some that are.
    
- Have a maximum recursivity setting somewhere in GenericDocumentParserFactory?
