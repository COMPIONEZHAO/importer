TODO:
==============

- To remove/adjust when released in Apache Tika:

    - Remove CharsetDetector in favor of Tika original one once fixed:
      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2219

    - Remove WordPerfect, Quattro Pro, ans XFDL from 
      GenericDocumentParserFactory as well as from custom-mimetypes.xml.
      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-1946
      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2228
      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2222
      
    - Remove copy of PDF2XHTML from Importer once upgrading to Tika 1.15.

    - Remove JBIG2-related code/files if accepted:
      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2232

- Wherever a duration is specified in milliseconds, allow to have a string
  representation instead, that will be converted to milliseconds 
  (e.g. 2.5s, or 2 minutes and 30 secondes)

- Allow to specify data unit for DocumentLengthTagger (with locale and decimal
  precision).

- Find out if we can reduce metadata extraction on images to avoid 
  OOMException on some images with massive amount of metadata.

- Investigate Tika Named Entity Parser: 
  https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaAndNER

- Investigate Tika Natural Language Toolkit: 
  https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaAndNLTK

- Maybe ship with a default tika-config on a given path so it can easily be
  modified: https://tika.apache.org/1.12/configuring.html

- Add better defined Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) support, 
  leveraging Tika GDAL support (requires external app install, like
  Tesserac OCR feature).

- Create an ImageConverterTransformer that would convert images from/to
  format of choice. This could allow for instance to convert some 
  formats non-supported by Tesseract OCR into some that are.
    
- Have a maximum recursivity setting somewhere in GenericDocumentParserFactory?
  Alternatively, consider moving to using RecursiveParserWrapper which 
  already supports that.
